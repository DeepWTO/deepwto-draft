# DeepWTO

## About the project 
This project is a continuation work of previous project, __[Auto-generation of GATT_WTO panel report](https://github.com/syyunn/GATT_WTO)__. 
Compare to the former task, this time the project has narrow downed to the classification task to predict which country wins the legal battle in __[WTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization)__ 
from the task of panel report generation. 

This project is assumed to achieve following two main goals:
1. Build a __dataset__ that everyone can participate in this legal prediction agenda in __objective manner__
2. Performs a classification with simple __neural network__ to set the baseline of the classification task.

Sometime later on, above two will be branched and managed to separate projects, however, those two are in a same repository at present.
