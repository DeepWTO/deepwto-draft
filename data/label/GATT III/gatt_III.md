### About the Labelling Process
[Jaewon Shin] and [Zachary Yoon] has conducted labelling about the 
inconsistency of GATT III with limiting its scope on GATT III itself, not 
narrowing down to the paragraph level, such as III:2, III:4 or III:8.

Labelling has conducted over the following listed 77 cases which have a panel
 report while the GATT:III is cited by the panel. 

[2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 31, 69, 72, 75, 84, 87, 108, 110, 135, 136, 
139, 142, 146, 152, 155, 161, 162, 169, 174, 175, 231, 265, 266, 267, 276, 
283, 290, 301, 302, 308, 316, 332, 339, 340, 342, 343, 353, 360, 363, 366, 
371, 381, 384, 386, 391, 396, 400, 401, 403, 406, 412, 426, 435, 438, 441, 
444, 445, 447, 453, 456, 458, 467, 472, 475, 476, 477, 478, 484, 497, 499]

We had labelled those with 1, 0 or mutually agreed, and omit the cases of 
mutually agreed from the final train dataset which are ended as mutually agreed in the middle of 
panel process goes on. 

1 is the cases which are clearly determined as inconsistent with GATT:III by
 Panel, while the 0 is the label which holds the multiple different cases - where 
non-applicable, judicial economy or some cases omitted under the mutual 
consideration with other provision, such as TBT. For details, please refer 
to the raw directory
