# Label on Legal Consistency

# General Principle
# AppellateBody must entail all articles cited in Panel => False
# AppellateBody only tracks reversion(or retain) of Panel's Decision => False
# AB sometimes finds more inconsistency with some article not cited in Panel
# .e.g. [DS108]

# Judicial Economy
# Some articles cited in consultation not being dealt in Panel/AB, since
# the Panel/AB exerts judicial economy

# Level of Scope
# GATT III: must be entail to the second level

#  1 : consistent
# -1 : violation
#  0 : unable to determine
#      {Insufficient information[DS18, DS98ABR],
#       Unable to apply[DS22],
#       Failed to identify "specific measure at issue" [DS60]}

# On Tips upon Labelling:
# After the case of DS67, the Panel/AB starts its customary act to
# explicitly denotes the legality with accordance to the specific article.
# Thus, in case the one-page-summary vague, refer to the final conclusion of
# original paper

# RW is the footnote marker to denote the case where the fixed measure was
#  not agreed by the members of disputes. Refer to DSU21.5 for the ground
#  article.
# The consistency of restoration measure also fought in panel/AB
